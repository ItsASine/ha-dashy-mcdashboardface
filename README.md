# ha-dashy-mcdashboardface

*A Home Assistant dashboard made of YAML, vibes, and a sadness for Dwain's being no longer maintained.*

This is our personal Mushroom UI setup, built for a tablet-friendly, clean interface. It's designed for our household, but you're welcome to fork it or take ideas from it.

**Features:**
- Person chips with current zone and map tap-through
- Room cards with at-a-glance temperature and device status
- Clean rounded-corner aesthetic via Mushroom cards
- No third-party services, iframe nonsense, or abandoned frameworks

> You can install this manually or as a custom HACS dashboard repo.
